# Dank Memer's Audio Files

This is a folder of audio files that we use in various sound commands within Dank Memer.

### Installing
There are 3 things you can try. (Because git is annoying sometimes)

A) `git submodule update --init`

B) `git submodule foreach git pull origin master`

C) `cd src/assets/audio` then `git pull origin master`
